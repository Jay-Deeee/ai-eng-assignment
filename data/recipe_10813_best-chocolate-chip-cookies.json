The cookies retained their shape and didn't spread when baked. I think the cream of tartar made a difference, and the cookies did not come out too cakey either!

Crispy edges and gooey center. My husband works from home and he can't stop coming out of his office and trying them!!!! HUGE hit and will be my go to. Thank you!!",
